# Apptainer Images Directory

This directory contains the Apptainer (formerly Singularity) images of the trained models.

## Purpose
Store containerized versions of trained models to ensure consistent runtime environments across different systems.

## Usage
Images in this directory can be executed using Apptainer to run model inference or further training.

## Note
Do not directly modify the image files. To update a model, create a new image following the build procedures in the project documentation.
